# Summary

This is a simple tool to convert the output of the MediaPipe Pose model to a BVH file. The BVH file can be used to animate a 3D character in Blender or any other 3D software that supports the BVH format. It also generates blendshapes for the face. The blendshapes can be used to animate a 3D character's face in Blender or any other 3D software that supports blendshapes.

# Statement of need

The MediaPipe Pose model outputs the 3D coordinates of 33 keypoints on the human body. The keypoints include the 25 keypoints of the body, 21 keypoints of the left hand, 21 keypoints of the right hand, and 468 keypoints of the face. The 3D coordinates of these keypoints can be used to animate a 3D character in Blender or any other 3D software that supports the BVH format. The 3D coordinates of the face keypoints can be used to generate blendshapes for the face. The blendshapes can be used to animate a 3D character's face in Blender or any other 3D software that supports blendshapes.

# Key Features

- Converts the output of the MediaPipe Pose model to a BVH file.
- Generates blendshapes for the face.
- Hand tracking.

# Installation

This software is released under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3). The complete license is provided as LICENSE.txt




# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
