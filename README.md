# mediapipe-pose2bvh

This is a simple tool to convert the output of the MediaPipe Pose model to a BVH file. The BVH file can be used to animate a 3D character in Blender or any other 3D software that supports the BVH format. It also generates blendshapes for the face. The blendshapes can be used to animate a 3D character's face in Blender or any other 3D software that supports blendshapes.

## Usage
    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tejaswigowda/mediapipe-pose2bvh.git
cd mediapipe-pose2bvh
http-server
```

Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/` and upload the JSON file generated by the MediaPipe Pose model. The BVH file and the blendshapes will be generated and downloaded.



## Statement of need

The MediaPipe Pose model outputs the 3D coordinates of 33 keypoints on the human body. The keypoints include the 25 keypoints of the body, 21 keypoints of the left hand, 21 keypoints of the right hand, and 468 keypoints of the face. The 3D coordinates of these keypoints can be used to animate a 3D character in Blender or any other 3D software that supports the BVH format. The 3D coordinates of the face keypoints can be used to generate blendshapes for the face. The blendshapes can be used to animate a 3D character's face in Blender or any other 3D software that supports blendshapes.
